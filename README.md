## Usage
### For windows
1. Download the program from the link above.
2. Create a file with ".mpl" extension.
3. Open it with the downloaded program. (Right click -> open with ... )
4. If your file is not empty and does not contain syntax errors, the program will automatically close and create same-named file with ".crpl" extension.
You can translate multiple files at the same time.

### For Linux & OS X
1. Clone the repo.
2. Try something like `g++ --std=c++14 *.cpp -o mplCompiler` in src folder. (I haven't used any windows-specific features.)
3. Launch with `./mplCompiler file1.mpl file2.mpl file3.mpl`

## Overview
This language was created to simplify the writing of a program in the CRPL language.
The main goals:
1. Save all CRPL language functionality.
2. Make the process of writing programs on the CRPL easier, while maintaining the speed of the final CRPL code.
